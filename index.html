							<h1>Chris Weaver</h1>
							<p>I'm a Master's student at UC San Diego pursuing an MS in Computer Science with a focus on
         Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, and I expect to graduate in Spring 2020.
         Before that, I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a BS in Computer Science also at UC San Diego. The last
         two summers (2018 and 2019) I've been a Software Development Engineering
         Intern at Amazon where I worked on the Media Services and Tax Platforms teams
         respectively. </p>
       <p>I'm currently looking for a full time Software/Research Engineering position for Fall 2020</p>

         <h3>Chess AI</h3>
         <p>Based on DeepMind's AlphaZero paper, competing with friends on who can
            design, build, and train the best performing chess AI. Written with
            Python/TensorFlow and using a GTX 1080TI for training.

         <h3>Hard Negative Mining for Correspondance</h3>
         <p>Working with Professor Manmohan Chandraker at UCSD, I am working on
            applying new hard negative mining techniques to existing state of the
            art correspondance networks. Specifically. I am modifying a PyTorch
            implementation of SuperPoint to use random sampling, GPU based KNN, and
            GPU based Locality Sensitive Hashing KNN to find hard negative examples
            during training time.

         <h3>Review Sentiment Classification</h3>
         <p>As part of a NLP kaggle competition at UC San Diego, I built a
            word-embedding based, semi-supervised review sentiment classifier. I
            placed in the top 5% of all contestants.
            The point of the contest was creative feature design - we were restricted to
            using logistic regression for the final classification. My final design
            used regularized document embeddings
            (average of the word embeddings of the document) using FastText (trained
            with both the review datset and web crawls).

									<h3>Tables</h3>
									<p>Tables is an Android application built by a team of students at UCSD
           led by myself. It allows UCSD to meet other students over a meal.
           It's goal is to make the task of meeting new people in an unfamiliar
           environment easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable.
           It has verified account creation, profile creation, an intelligent
           matching algorithm to match those that share similar interests, and a
           built in chat room. Tables was built in Android Studio with Java.
           We used Git/GitHub for version control and Firebase as the database
           to hold user information and for the chat rooms. The project also
           uses a layered design. Following MVC principles, classes are divided
           to deal with a specific set of goals. Additionally, many industry
           document were created throughout the development of the application,
           such as User Stories, Requirements, and a Database Schema
           (just to name a few). </p>
