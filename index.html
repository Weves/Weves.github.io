									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>When I started at UCSD, like most people my age, I had no idea what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I started as an Economics major, but quickly realized that it wasn't for me. From there, I found Computer Science and I couldn't be happier. As a result, I am looking for a software engineering internship for the summer of 2018. </p>

								<div class="inner">
									<p>I pride myself and trying to be the best at every endeavour I take part in, and throughout my life I have largely been successful at doing so. On the right, you can see me holding up my bridge that I used to enter a bridge building competition. Everyone was given the same amount of wooden rod and string to build a bridge. Through a simple observation, that the string should be used solely to replace wood in places where the force would be entirely a pulling force, I was able to design and construct the winning bridge, which was able to hold over 135 pounds attached to its center.</p>

									<h3>Tables</h3>
									<p>Tables is an Android application built by myself as well as a team of other students that I led. It allows UCSD to meet other students over a meal. It's goal is to make the task of meeting new people in an unfamiliar environment easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable. It has verified account creation, profile creation, an intelligent matching algorithm to match those that share similar interests, and a built in chat room. In the future, I hope to add machine learning for the matching algorithm and yelp integration into the chat room to allow users to locate the best place to eat within the application. </p>
								</section>
								
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-chain"></span>
									<h4>Implementation</h4>
									<p>Tables was built in Android Studio with Java. We used Git/GitHub for version control and Firebase as the database to hold user information and for the chat rooms. The project also attempts a layered design. Following MVC principles, classes are divided to deal with a specific set of goals. Additionally, many industry document were created throughout the development of the application, such as User Stories, Requirements, and a Database Schema (just to name a few). </p>

									<h3>Blackjack Simulator</h3>
									<p>Blackjack Simulator is exactly what it sounds like: a program that simulates a blackjack game to predict the best move in a given situation. Given a hand, a number of players, a dealers face up card, and a deck state (that you can continuously update), it runs that situation many times for each possible move you could make (hit, stand, etc.) and calculates the expected return on each and reccomends the move that gives you the best average outcome.</p>

									<h4>Implementation</h4>
									<p>Blackjack simulator was built in Visual Studio using C# as a console application with no extra bells and whistles.</p>
